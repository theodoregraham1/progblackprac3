    <h1>What is automation</h1>
    <p>Automation is the utilisation of computing technology to perform a task in a consistent and (generally) efficient manner</p>
    <p>Utilising automations has many benefits, such as 
        <a href = "#Saving_Time">saving time</a>,or
        <a href = "#Reducing_Danger">reducing danger</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 id = "Saving_Time">Saving Time</h1>
    <p>Computers are much faster than humans at solving many problems, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting Lists</li>
        <li>Searching for Items</li>
        <li>Solving Mathematical Equations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Similarly, computers are perfectly consistent, returning the same action for a given input.</p>
    <p>As a result, an automation can be used to repeatedly perform a task in seconds what might take a human hours.</p>
    <p>This cumulatively saved time is then able to be used in other endeavours, or potentially result in more free-time.</p>

    <h2>Examples of saving time</h2>
    <p>Automations may seem like something that only benefit large organisations with lots of menial tasks to perform on loop.</p>
    <p>However, almost everything we do in our day-to-day lives has benefitted from automation.</p>
    <p>Take Google Maps for example.</p>
    <p>Google Maps uses an automation to finding the "best" route from A to B.</p>
    <p>This automation can find such a route in moments, a task which could take you a much longer time to just find A SINGLE route.</p>
    <p>For another example, consider phone calls.</p>
    <p>Years ago, to make a phone call you'd have to dial the phone number then ask someone to physically connect your phone line to that person.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, you only have to press a button or two on your phone and you will be connected to someone else in no time.</p>
    <p>What your phone is doing to connect you with your friend is an automation. One which saves you a lot of time.</p>

    <h1 id = "Reducing_Danger">Reducing Danger</h1>
    <p>Automations present opportunities to reduce the danger in heavy industries</p>
    <p>The primary automation improving safety is robotics, according to <a href = "https://www.getac.com/en/blog/safety-technologies-for-heavy-industries/">getac</a></p>
    <p>By performing certain tasks, such as moving components around a warehouse, or putting components into place during manufacturing, 
        automations remove humans from potentially dangerous situations, allowing them to perform tasks from a safe distance.</p>
