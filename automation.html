                    <li>Automation is the utilisation of computing technology to perform a task in a consistent and (generally) efficient manner.</li>
                    <li>Utilising automations has many benefits, such as

                    <li>Computers are much faster than humans at solving many problems, such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sorting Lists</li>
                        <li>Searching for Items</li>
                        <li>Solving Mathematical Equations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Similarly, computers are perfectly consistent, returning the same action for a given input.</li>
                    <li>As a result, an automation can be used to repeatedly perform a task in seconds what might take a human hours.</li>
                    <li>This cumulatively saved time is then able to be used in other endeavours, or potentially result in more free-time.</li>

                    <li>Automations may seem like something that only benefit large organisations with lots of menial tasks to perform on loop.</li>
                    <li>However, almost everything we do in our day-to-day lives has benefitted from automation.</li>
                    <li>Take Google Maps for example.</li>
                    <li>Google Maps uses an automation to finding the "best" route from A to B.</li>
                    <li>This automation can find such a route in moments, a task which could take you a much longer time to just find A SINGLE route.</li>
                    <li>For another example, consider phone calls.</li>
                    <li>Years ago, to make a phone call you'd have to dial the phone number then ask someone to physically connect your phone line to that person.</li>
                    <li>Nowadays, you only have to press a button or two on your phone and you will be connected to someone else in no time.</li>
                    <li>What your phone is doing to connect you with your friend is an automation. One which saves you a lot of time.</li>
