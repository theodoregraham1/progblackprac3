i.Interest of content

not much written (other than automation)
automation looks like it had a lot of effort put in

the others had some good points just aren't very expanded on


ii.Consistency and quality of visual presentation

menue bar on top is nice, apart from the hyperlinks not being centered.
the index page isn't really an index.

pages look more like notes than web pages
style is more or less consistent
    - the medicine page has a page split none of the others do and is the only one with a bibliography
    - automation is the only page without small subtitles and paragraphs going across the full page


iii.Quality of written presentation

not sure what this question wants exactly and it's bugging me so lets just say you did it perfectly


iv.Validity of HTML

all seems pretty valid 
nothing to criticise


v.Evidence of collaboration including

Clearly all articles have been written by group members.
Large number of commits hence collaboration is evident.

well balanced 
and info on who wrote what page is given
