Interest of content

Content is interesting. Suitable topics have been chosen. The pages stay on topic - no tangents or crossover.




Consistency and quality of visual presentation

Header is very clear and practical for navigation. Pages are clearly laid out. Visual design/formatting is relatively simple.




Quality of written presentation

Page content is well written and layed out. Some inconsistencies between pages, such as the bibliography. 




Validity of HTML

HTML seems to work fine. Possible issue with Bootstrap JS link, but apparently inconsequential for this particular site.
